# To Do

# Bug fixes

# Clean up
- Files to integrate:
  - create_prospective_forecast

- Files to update data sources:
  

# Upgrades

### DONE

### Theoretical / model structure
- Virus data - no running subtype data available for states
  - Can we get this data?
  - Subtype historical average - can build kernels, but can't build CV forecasts accurately
  - Dynamic harmonic - can't use season to date subtype data as covariates
      
- Pull information across regions for regional/state forecasts?
  - Maybe lagged terms as covariates? (k = 1, 2, 3, etc weeks)
  - Unclear how to get data for this to base a prediction on - circular dependencies possible
  - Could include Google Trends data from other regions in the existing models
  - Could do multi-step process - single region models to get predictions, which then inform models that 
    have information from multiple regions
  
- Probabilistic measure for if onset has already happened?
  
- Reloop through Fourier, ARIMA, covariate CV steps to validate earlier decisions

### COVID
- Covariate in dynamic harmonic model?
- Separate model to include in ensemble, leaving dynamic harmonic model alone?

- For both, how to evaluate COVID predictions?
  - Data only begin to really show up in Week 8/9 on 2019/2020 flu season

### Practical
- Automatic runs on Monday mornings
- Automatic commit of Monday forecasts
- Automatic push of Monday forecasts
- Use ec2 server for this? Or at least automatic virologic data pulls?
