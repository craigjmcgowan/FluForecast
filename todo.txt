# To Do

# Clean up
- Files to integrate:
  - subtype_weight_avg
  - create_prospective_forecast
- Files to update data sources:
  - create_dynamic_regression
  - create_dynamic_regression_state
  - calculate_scores
  - calculate_scores_state
  - 


# Upgrades
- Probabilistic measure for if onset has already happened?
- Estimate virologic backfill
- Other ways to integrate backfill rather than simple regression term
- Pull information across regions for regional/state forecasts?
  - Maybe lagged terms as covariates? (k = 1, 2, 3, etc weeks)
- Automatic runs on Monday mornings
- Automatic commit of Monday forecasts
- Automatic push of Monday forecasts
