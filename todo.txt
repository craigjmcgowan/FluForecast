# To Do

# Clean up
- Integrate create_prospective_forecast and create_prospective_forecast_state; single file to generate all forecasts
- Any way to make model fitting run faster?
- 


# Upgrades
- Probabilistic measure for if onset has already happened?
- Estimate virologic backfill
- Other ways to integrate backfill rather than simple regression term
- Pull information across regions for regional/state forecasts?
  - Maybe lagged terms as covariates? (k = 1, 2, 3, etc weeks)
- Automatic runs on Monday mornings
- Automatic commit of Monday forecasts
- Automatic push of Monday forecasts
